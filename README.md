Sample image based on the "buildah-tweakstreet" base image from my other repository. The base image is just a blueprint providing the basic infrastructure. A concrete implementation based on this blueprint then allows to run an instance of the Tweakstreet ETL tool in a container.

This is used to demonstrate how to create and configure a new image to run the ETL tool.
